# Portland Thai United — Static Site

A fast, single-page site with no external dependencies. Edit `index.html` to customize sections. 

## Quick Start
1. Unzip the bundle.
2. Double-click `index.html` to preview locally.
3. Deploy by dragging the folder to Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.

## Customize
- Replace schedule/roster text directly in `index.html`.
- Swap the crest by replacing the `src` data URI on the two `<img>` tags.
- Hook up the contact form by replacing the alert in `script.js` with your endpoint/fetch().
